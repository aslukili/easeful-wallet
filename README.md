# easeful-wallet
A couple of microservices communicating with each other with eureka as the discovery server and OpenFeign as the web client.

! contribution:
I tried to get the services up and running using docker compose, but for reason, the services can't find each other.

to run the project: you need a mongodb database to run wallet server, a postgresql for running the transaction service.
